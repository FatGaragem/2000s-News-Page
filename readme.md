# Welcome recruiters and friends.

This is an academic project, whose objective is to test my knowledge in javaScript,html, css and Bootstrap.

According to the goals set by me, this project, in addition to the basic functionality of a page, should also have next button, back button and animations. It should also have a minimally pleasant interface. THEY ARE NOT RESPONSIVE!
